                        <p>An odd story but when I was a child, my parents and I often frequented a Taco Bell/Pizza Hut
                            (which I call Taco Hut) fast food restaurant on Maui. It was a convenient place to eat
                            because it was in between where we stayed and where we would go into town. One day, we had
                            an activity to do on a boat for the day and we had to rush in the morning so we had no time
                            to eat. Once we finished our activity, we went to our trusty Taco Hut and ordered some pizza
                            to sit down. I was so hungry because we had not eaten all day! So me being the loud child I
                            was I said to my parents, "why haven't we eaten all day? I am so hungry!" Sure enough
                            someone heard us inside and decided to leave money for us to pay for our meal. They must
                            have thought we had not eaten because we had no money but this was not the case. This is a
                            story we still tell to this day and it makes me laugh.</p>

                        <p>One of the most exctiting things I have ever done was done on Maui. Maui offers many
                            different adventures and activities you can do and the one I chose was to bicycle down an
                            active volcano, Haleakalā. You have to wake up at the crack of dawn and take a bus to the
                            top of the volcano, once you are there you and your group are given time to see the
                            beautiful sites atop the volcano. At around 7 P.M. it is time to actual cycle down. It takes
                            almost the entirety of your day but it is one of the coolest things I have ever done.</p>

                        <p>One of my favorite moments comes as an adult on Maui. My girlfriend at the time had never
                            been to Hawaii ever and we had a wedding to attend. We decided to spend the money and attend
                            the wedding, and that is when I decided that if we were going to take this trip that I
                            should propose. The first night we were there we had a very nice sushi dinner, went out for
                            a couple drinks, we then went to a beach and that is where i proposed to my fiancé.</p>

                        As you can see, Maui has played an incredible part in my life, not only at one time but through
                        my life. I have been there many times since I was about 5 years old and I still continue to go.
                        I even think we might have our honeymoon there.
